# Branching/Merging Strategy
The `main` branch is the parent branch, the most current version of the application resides here.

Branches should be created by a developer when they are assigned a specific ticket in Jira.

Branch name should be named `sys-#/description-of-card` and spun off of branch `main`.

When acceptance criteria of the card has been met and is ready for review, developer must open a Pull Request, targeting `main`.
The pull request must then be reviewed and approved by another developer if everything checks out. PR reviewer can also leave feedback or criticism as they wish.

This process ensures that developers can get more comfortable with all parts of the codebase as well and as operating as a basic QA proccess.
